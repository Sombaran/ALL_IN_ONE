A stack overflow error can occur in a computer program due to excessive memory usage. This excessive memory usage occurs on the call stack, which is where information is stored relating to the active subroutines in the program. The call stack has a limited amount of memory available to it. Its size is determined by the programming language, the architecture, whether multi-threading is available on the CPU, and how much memory is available.

Usually, when a stack overflow error occurs, the program crashes and can either freeze or close the program. Any unsaved data or work is lost. The stack overflow error is often caused by an infinite loop or the creation of variables larger than the size of the call stack.

The stack overflow problem is not as prevalent on the newer operating systems, however, because of the small footprint on mobile devices it can become challenging. If your mobile device's operating system is giving you a stack overflow error, you may have too many applications running, a virus uses stack space, or your device has bad hardware. Check your app usage and virus protection and run a memory diagnostic app on your mobile device to see if this helps clear up your error.

What Does Stack Overflow Mean?
A stack overflow is a runtime error that happens when a program runs out of memory in the call stack. The stack overflow generally signals a problem in resource provisioning and has to be fixed in order to allow the program to run and use memory properly.

Techopedia Explains Stack Overflow
It is important to point out that a stack overflow is a logical runtime error and not a syntax error. Syntax errors result when the computer cannot read a section of code correctly, and these errors are caught by the compiler or at other key points before production. A stack overflow, on the other hand, happens “in the mix” and can be hard to figure out.

Stack overflows can be caused by not allocating enough memory to a particular program. They can also be caused by a codebase where the coder or developer did not remember memory limits and programmed the executable to exceed them. Many programmers consider recursive functions as a major culprit: With recursion, the iterative process eats up all of the available memory and then triggers a stack overflow.
