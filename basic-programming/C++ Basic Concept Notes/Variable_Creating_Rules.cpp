// What are the rules to declare variables in C++?
/*
To declare a variable, you need to know what data type it is going to be of and what its name would be. The variable name has constraints on what you can name it. Following are the rules for naming variables âˆ’

 - Variable names in C++ can range from 1 to 255 characters.
 - All variable names must begin with a letter of the alphabet or an underscore(_).
 - After the first initial letter, variable names can also contain letters and numbers.
 - Var1iable names are case sensitive.
 - No spaces or special characters are allowed.
 - You cannot use a C++ keyword (a reserved word) as a variable name.
