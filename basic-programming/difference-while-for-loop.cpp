// difference between while and for loop

//     Command	
//         The structure of for loop is â€“
//             for(initial condition; number of iterations){//body of the loop }	
//         Structure of while loop is-
//             While(condition){statements;//body}

//     Iterations	
//         Iterates for a preset number of times.	
//         Iterates till a condition is met.

//     Condition	
//         In the absence of a condition, the loop iterates for an infinite number of
//           times till it reaches break command.	
//         In the absence of a condition, while loop shows an error.

//     Initialization	
//         Initialization in for loop is done only once when the program starts.	
//         Initialization is done every time the loop is iterated.

//     Use	
//         Used to obtain the result only when the number of iterations is known.	
//         Used to satisfy the condition when the number of iterations is unknown.
