/*

Can a char pointer point to integer?
    When casting character pointer to integer pointer, integer pointer holds some weird value, no where reasonably related to char or char ascii code. But while printing casted variable with ‘%c’, it prints correct char value. Printing with ‘%d’ gives some unknown numbers.

Can a char be converted to int?
    You can convert a char type simply by assigning to an int . char is just a 1 byte integer. There is nothing magic with the char type! Just as you can assign a short to an int, or an int to a long, you can assign a char to an int.

Can you assign pointer to int to pointer to char?
    By casting a integer pointer to a char pointer, will they both contain the same address? Both pointers would point to the same location in memory. Does the cast operation change the value of what the char pointer points to? No, it changes the default interpretation of what the pointer points to.

Can char be converted to int in c?
    Char to int C – Convert a character digit to the corresponding integer in C program. For example, if the character is ‘5’ (char c =’5′) then corresponding int number will be 5. The conversion is very simple and just we have to Subtract ‘0’ like below example.

What is the size of char pointer in C?
    8 bytes
    The size of a char pointer is 8 bytes!

Can a char pointer be converted to an int pointer?
    But, no, you were not doing anything like that. Yes, in C, a character pointer ( char *) is often used to refer to a string. But this does not mean that by converting something to a char *, you are converting it to a string. (Again, all you’re converting is the pointer.) The bytes which make up the value 1025 are always going to be 0x04 and 0x01.

How to convert a char to an int in C and C + +?
    C++ Programming Server Side Programming In C language, there are three methods to convert a char type variable to an int. These are given as follows −

Which is the function to convert a char * to an integer?
    However, you are probably looking for the atoi and atof functions. atoi is a function that converts a char* pointing to a string containing an integer in decimal to an integer . atof is likewise for double.

How to cast a char * to an int or a double?
    You can cast a char* like this: char *c = “123.45”; int i = (int) c; // cast to int double d = (double) c; // cast to double. But that will give nonsensical results. It just coerces the pointer to be treated as an integer or double.

Is char and int in c same?
    char: The most basic data type in C. It stores a single character and requires a single byte of memory in almost all compilers. int: As the name suggests, an int variable is used to store an integer. float: It is used to store decimal numbers (numbers with floating point value) with single precision.

What is a char pointer in c?
    The type of both the variables is a pointer to char or (char*) , so you can pass either of them to a function whose formal argument accepts an array of characters or a character pointer. Here are the differences: arr is an array of 12 characters.

Are pointers integers in c?
    Are pointers in C/C++ (or any language for that matter), integers? A pointer holds a memory address, from 0 to the upper limit of your memory. So in math terms, a pointer could be considered a non-negative integer.

What is the difference between int pointer and char pointer?
    Type char is a byte wide type. This means, it can store 8 bits of information. So type char can store numbers from -127 to 126. Type int is a 4-byte wide type, so it can store 32 bits of information.

What is an integer pointer?
    A pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable. For example, an integer variable holds (or you can say stores) an integer value, however an integer pointer holds the address of a integer variable.

Should I use char or int?
    5 Answers. The difference is the size in byte of the variable, and from there the different values the variable can hold. A char is required to accept all values between 0 and 127 (included). An int is required to be at least a 16 bits signed word, and to accept all values between -32767 and 32767.

What is size of char in C?
    The minimum size for char is 8 bits, the minimum size for short and int is 16 bits, for long it is 32 bits and long long must contain at least 64 bits.

Why pointers are used in C?
    Pointers are used for file handling. Pointers are used to allocate memory dynamically. In C++, a pointer declared to a base class could access the object of a derived class. However, a pointer to a derived class cannot access the object of a base class.

What’s the difference between Char and int pointers in C?
    Now for the differences: Strictly speaking, both a pointer to char and a pointer to int are both “integer pointers”, as char in C is simply an integer type of size 1. Other types of integer pointers include pointers to short, long, unsigned char, etc.

What’s the difference between character array and character pointer?
    In this chapter, we will study the difference between character array and character pointer. Can you point out similarities or differences between them ? The type of both the variables is a pointer to char or (char*), so you can pass either of them to a function whose formal argument accepts an array of characters or a character pointer.

What does a pointer to an integer contain?
    A pointer to an integer contains a pointer to some integer (a specific integer variable), the first element of an array of integers, some other specific element of an array of integers, etc.).

What does sizeof ( char ) do to a pointer?
    So, sizeof (char) gives you 1, the number of bytes occupied by a char. If you dereference a pointer to a character, you get a 1-byte character value. If you increment a pointer to a character, the address inside the pointer variable moves forward by one memory location (1 byte).

Can pointer be Typecasted?
    We saw that pointer values may be assigned to pointers of same type. However, pointers may be type cast from one type to another type. In the following code lines, A is an int type variable, D is variable of type double, and ch is a variable of type char.

What happens when you cast a char pointer to an int pointer?
    Doesnt matter if the variable is a int or a char, if the first bit has the same position in the memory, then a pointer to that variable will look the same. the difference is when you operate on that pointer. If your pointer variable is p and it’s a int pointer, then p++ will increase the address that it contains of 4 bytes.

Can a pointer be cast from one type to another?
    However, pointers may be type cast from one type to another type. In the following code lines, A is an int type variable, D is variable of type double, and ch is a variable of type char. Pa is declared as a pointer to int variables, Pd is declared as a pointer to double type variables, and Pc is declared as pointer to character type variables.

What’s the difference between type casting of a variable and a pointer?
    Note the difference between the type casting of a variable and type casting of a pointer. Taking the above declarations of A, D, ch of the type int, double, and char, respectively. For type casting of D into type int, the code is While for type casting a double pointer Pd into pointer for int the code is as below.

How to type cast D into an int?
    For type casting of D into type int, the code is. 1. D = (int)D; While for type casting a double pointer Pd into pointer for int the code is as below. 1. Pd = (int*)pd;

Is a pointer an integer C++?
    What we Cannot do on a void pointer?
    Because the void pointer is used to cast the variables only, So pointer arithmetic can’t be done in a void pointer.

How to pass an integer pointer to a function?
    The key thing is to remember that when you do int *c you are allocating a pointer, when you do int c you are allocating an integer. If you wish to modify a variable passed to a function, the typical pattern in C is to pass the address of said variable but you first need to allocate the proper type, in this case an int and not an int * .

Why are pointers referred to as pointer to INT?
    In the example above, p is a pointer, and its type will be specifically be referred to as “pointer to int”, because it stores the address of an integer variable. We also can say its type is: int* The type is important. While pointers are all the same size, as they just store a memory address, we have to know what kind of thing they are pointing TO.

How to store a pointer as an integer in C + +?
    I’d say this is the modern C++ way. so the right way to store a pointer as an integer is to use the uintptr_t or intptr_t types. (See also in cppreference integer types for C99 ). these types are defined in for C99 and in the namespace std for C++11 in (see integer types for C++ ).

Can a C pointer be converted to an int?
    Transferring that analogy to your program: you are converting the object pointing to your int to an int itself. Since a C pointer is implemented as ‘the number of a memory cell’, and since there are lots of memory cells available, it’s obvious that (int)p will result in a very big number. Casting is a nasty thing.

    An integer pointer should only point to integer data, while a character pointer should only point to character data. Since a char is only 1 byte, the pointer to the next char would naturally also be 1 byte over. But since an integer is 4 bytes, a pointer to the next integer has to be 4 bytes over.

Can you cast a pointer in C?
    In the C language, casting is a construct to view a data object temporarily as another data type. When you cast pointers, especially for non-data object pointers, consider the following characteristics and constraints: You can cast a pointer to another pointer of the same IBM® i pointer type.

Can a pointer to INT be cast to char?
    No, as you can see from the rule, you can safely cast your pointer to int to be a pointer to char (or unsigned char, or signed char). This makes sense as you’re reinterpreting the int as a sequence of bytes… but that is exactly what the underlying storage of the int consists of!

Which is a pointer to a char variable?
    In the following code lines, A is an int type variable, D is variable of type double, and ch is a variable of type char. Pa is declared as a pointer to int variables, Pd is declared as a pointer to double type variables, and Pc is declared as pointer to character type variables. Pa is assigned the value &A.
