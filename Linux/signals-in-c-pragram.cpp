// Signals in C language
//     A signal is a software generated interrupt that is sent to a process by the OS.
//     because when user press ctrl-c or another process tell something to this process.

//     There are fix set of signals that can be sent to a process.
//     signal are identified by integers.
//     Signal number have symbolic names.

//     For example SIGCHLD is number of the signal sent to the parent process
//     when child terminates.

//     Examples:
//         #define SIGHUP  1   /* Hangup the process */
//         #define SIGINT  2   /* Interrupt the process */
//         #define SIGQUIT 3   /* Quit the process */
//         #define SIGILL  4   /* Illegal instruction. */
//         #define SIGTRAP 5   /* Trace trap. */
//         #define SIGABRT 6   /* Abort. */

//     OS Structures for Signals
//     For each process, the operating system maintains 2 integers with the bits corresponding to a signal numbers.
//     The two integers keep track of:
//          pending signals
//          blocked signals
//     With the two 32 bit integers, up to 32 different signals can be represented.
//     Example :
//     In the example below, the SIGINT ( = 2) signal is blocked and no signals are pending.

//         Pending Signals :

//         31  30  29  28  .....  3    2   1   0
//         0   0   0   0   .....  0    0   0   0

//         Blocked Signals :

//         31  30  29  28  .....  3    2   1   0
//         0   0   0   0   .....  0    1   0   0

//     A signal is sent to a process setting the corresponding bit in the pending signals integer for the process.
//     Each time the OS selects a process to be run on a processor, the pending and blocked integers are checked.
//     If no signals are pending, the process is restarted normally and continues executing at its next instruction.

//     If 1 or more signals are pending, but each one is blocked, the process is also restarted normally but with the signals still marked as pending.
//     If 1 or more signals are pending and NOT blocked, the OS executes the routines in the process's code to handle the signals.

//     Default Signal Handlers :
//         There are several default signal handler routines.
//         Each signal is associated with one of these default handler routine.
//         The different default handler routines typically have one of the following actions:

//         Ign: Ignore the signal; i.e., do nothing, just return
//         Term: terminate the process
//         Cont: unblock a stopped process
//         Stop: block the process

//     // CPP program to illustrate default Signal Handler
//     #include<stdio.h>
//     #include<signal.h>

//     int main()
//     {
//         signal(SIGINT, handle_sigint);
//         while (1)
//         {
//             printf("hello world\n");
//             sleep(1);
//         }
//         return 0;
//     }

//     Output:
//         Print hello world infinite times.
//         If user presses ctrl-c to terminate the process because of SIGINT signal sent and its default handler to terminate the process.

//         hello world
//         hello world
//         hello world
//         terminated

// User Defined Signal Handlers:

//     A process can replace the default signal handler for almost all signals
//     (but not SIGKILL) by its userâ€™s own handler function.
//     A signal handler function can have any name, but must have 
//     return type void and have one int parameter.

//     Example: 
//     you might choose the name sigchld_handler for a signal handler for the SIGCHLD signal (termination of a child process).

//     Then the declaration would be:
//         void sigchld_handler(int sig);

//     When a signal handler executes, the parameter passed to it is the number of the signal.
//     A programmer can use the same signal handler function to handle several signals.
//     In this case the handler would need to check the parameter to see which signal was sent.
//     On the other hand, if a signal handler function only handles one signal,
//     It is not necessary to check the parameter since it will always be that signal number.

// CPP program to illustrate
// User-defined Signal Handler
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>

// Handler for SIGINT, caused by
// Ctrl-C at keyboard
void handle_sigint(int sig)
{
    printf("Caught signal %d\n", sig);
}

int main()
{
    signal(SIGINT, handle_sigint);
    while (1)
        ;
    return 0;
}
