// Observer Pattern

//     Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple
//         objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

//     Observer defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state,
//         all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
//     The pattern has a behavioral purpose and applies to the objects.
/**
 * Observer Design Pattern
 *
 * Intent: Lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects
 * about any events that happen to the object they're observing.
 *
 * Note that there's a lot of different terms with similar meaning associated
 * with this pattern. Just remember that the Subject is also called the
 * Publisher and the Observer is often called the Subscriber and vice versa.
 * Also the verbs "observe", "listen" or "track" usually mean the same thing.
